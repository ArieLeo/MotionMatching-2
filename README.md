Motion Matching implementation for the Unity game engine. This project is part of my master thesis, which you can download [here](.github/pdfs/Master_Thesis_JoseLuis.pdf) to obtain a detailed description of both Motion Matching and this project. I intend to update this project in my spare time, adding more features until it is a complete Motion Matching solution for Unity.

I want to thank [Daniel Holden](https://theorangeduck.com/) for his comprehensive articles about data-driven animations, and his paper [Learned motion matching](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386569.3392440) which encouraged me to start researching about character animation and creating this project.
